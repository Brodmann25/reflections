3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Git is really good to track logical changes
4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think it's useful when you can make commits to all file, because of multi files have involved in such work more often.  
5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use giy log to see history of changes and defyne changes on reading my comments and remember to use logically justified commmits.   
6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's good to be sure that you have all necessary versions of your program while you working on it because you can get back to older versions without bug
7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
